People love points. I get points for contributing to various projects like Stack Overflow, and I can see how many people view personal sites like my blog. But the content I produce for Wikipedia has a far greater impact on the world than my blog or StackOverflow account ever will. I should get some points for that.

This is currently a personal project that I may or may not ever do anything with. The main features currently are:
  * Given a date and a wikipedia article, find out how many times the article has been viewed since the date.
  * Given a Wikipedia User, get the list of every article that user has ever edited and the dates on which the user first edited the articles. Then use the feature above to get the total number of times that User's work has been viewed.
